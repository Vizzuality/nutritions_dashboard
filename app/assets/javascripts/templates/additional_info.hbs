If {{title}} and others worldwide do their part, the results could be tremendous: 3.7 million child lives saved, at least 65 million fewer stunted children, 265 million fewer women suffering from anemia than in 2015, and 91 million children treated for severe wasting. In a resource-constrained environment, the smaller package of priority interventions could save about 2.2 million lives, and -- together with anticipated progress in food availability and diversity, women's health and education, and investments in water and sanitation -- could result in 50 million fewer children stunted in 2025 compared to 2015. It would also result in 91 million children treated for severe wasting.
